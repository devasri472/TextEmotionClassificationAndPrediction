# 🌈✨ Text Emotion Classification and Prediction 🚭💡

Welcome to the **Text Emotion Classification and Prediction** project! 🚀\
This project is all about understanding **human emotions** 😄😢😡🤔 conveyed through text using the power of **Artificial Intelligence** 🤖 and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🧠📚.

---

## 📌 **What is this project?**

This project offers a **comprehensive solution** to handle the nuances of language and emotional expression by categorizing emotions in text using **machine learning** and **ensemble learning** approaches. It’s designed to predict emotions such as:

- **Happiness** 😊
- **Sadness** 😢
- **Anger** 😠
- **Fear** 😨
- **Surprise** 😲

By leveraging advanced models like **Logistic Regression**, **SVC**, **Bagging Classifier**, **LightGBM**, and **Extra Trees Classifier**, combined into a **Voting Classifier**, this project ensures high accuracy and robust results.

## 🔼 **How to Get Started?**

1. Clone this repository 📂:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devasri472/TextEmotionClassification.git
   cd TextEmotionClassification
   ```

2. Install dependencies 🔨:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset 📚:

   - Format: CSV with columns like `Text` and `Emotion`.
   - Example:
     ```
     | Text                          | Emotion   |
     |-------------------------------|-----------|
     | I love this! ❤️               | Happiness |
     | I feel so down today. 😞      | Sadness   |
     ```

4. Train the models 🏋️‍♂️:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. Test predictions 🔮:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --text "I'm so excited for today!"  
   ```

6. 🎉 Enjoy the magic of AI!

## 📊 **Pipeline Overview**

1. **Preprocessing**: Clean text by removing user handles and stopwords using **NeatText**.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use **Count Vectorizer** and **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical features.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Train models including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Classifier
     - Bagging Classifier
     - Extra Trees Classifier
     - LightGBM
   - Combine these models using a **Voting Classifier** with soft voting for higher accuracy.
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.
5. **Deployment**: Save the trained Voting Classifier model as `voting_classifier_model.pkl`.
