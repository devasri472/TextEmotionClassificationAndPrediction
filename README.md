✨ Text Emotion Classification and Prediction 🎭💡
Welcome to the Text Emotion Classification and Prediction project! 🚀
This project is all about understanding human emotions 😄😢😡🤔 conveyed through text using the power of Artificial Intelligence 🤖 and Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠📚.

📌 What is this project?
Ever wondered how apps detect your mood based on what you write? 📝🤔
This project does exactly that! Using cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning models, it analyzes text to predict emotions like:

Happiness 😊
Sadness 😢
Anger 😠
Fear 😨
Surprise 😲
🚀 Features
✨ Smart Emotion Detection: Predicts the emotion in any text input.
✨ Customizable Models: Train on your own datasets.
✨ Interactive Visualizations 📊: See the results like never before.
✨ Real-time Predictions 🕒: Instant emotion classification for live text input.
